# landing-page

This repo (repository) was created as part of the online-course "The Odin Project".

The goal is to learn the basics of webdevelopment. Part of the course is learning the main programming languages for webdevelopment HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Workflows and conventions in the world of programmig also will be touched. The course also teaches, how to use git and GitHub, which is an important and often used tool (Version Control System) for programmers - for private projects and in companies.

In this repo you will find my second project as part of the course. I wil create a landing-page using html and css. The goal is to make the page look like the given design (you can find it in the folder "goal-design"). All from scratch, there is no code given.
